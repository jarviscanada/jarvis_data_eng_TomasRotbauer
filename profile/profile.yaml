# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am a recent bachelor of applied science (BASc) graduate from the University of Toronto with a major in computer engineering. I specialized mostly in software, spanning from compiler development all the way to machine learning, as well as computer hardware and digital logic which allows me to understand how software runs at the processor level. As a software developer, I firmly believe that being able to work with/understanding lower levels of abstraction behind a program is a prerequisite to writing highly optimized code, and is what distinguishes a software engineer from a coder. In my eyes, programming is not just a job, but rather a skill and a personal hobby of mine that I enjoy practicing in my spare time. My countless personal and academic projects, as well as internship experience, demonstrate my wide background in not only software but also the engineering discipline in general. When it comes to writing code, I tend to think outside the box to deliver high-quality computer programs.

    description: Developed a minimum viable product (MVP) for demonstrating how hardware usage data could automatically be collected from Linux machines within a cluster and stored into a database. The design works primarily with Linux bash scripts which periodically obtain the necessary data and store it into a containerized PostgreSQL database instance.
  - name: "Core Java Apps"
    git_url: "/core_java"
    description:
      - "Twitter App: In progress. Stay tuned!"
      - "JDBC App: Implemented a simple data access object (DAO) application using Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API for accessing and running queries on a small relational database with a couple of tables. The application can perform all the fundamental CRUD (create, read, update & delete) operations on the local PostgreSQL instance via transactions."
      - "Grep App: Programmed with Java 8 and leveraged its latest features including the stream API and lambda functions to develop an application similar to the Linux built-in grep feature. The program searches recursively through a root directory to map out all files and finds the lines that match the user-specified Java regular expression. Compilation was handled with the Maven tool, and the final product was packaged into a Docker container using Dockerfiles."
