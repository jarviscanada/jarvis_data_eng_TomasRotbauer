# Introduction
In this project, I used Java 8 to develop an application similar to the Linux builtin
`grep` feature. Basically, the program searches recursively through a root directory
to map out any and all files contained. Next, it reads each of these files line-by-line
using a BufferedReader, and processes each extracted line with Java 8 streams making
use of the highly versatile lambda functions

Discuss the design of each app. What does the app do? What technologies have you used? (e.g. core java, libraries, lambda, IDE, docker, etc..)

# Quick Start
How to use your apps? 

#Implemenation
## Pseudocode
write `process` method pseudocode.

## Performance Issue
(30-60 words)
Discuss the memory issue and how would you fix it

# Test
How did you test your application manually? (e.g. prepare sample data, run some test cases manually, compare result)

# Deployment
How you dockerize your app for easier distribution?

# Improvement
List three things you can improve in this project.
